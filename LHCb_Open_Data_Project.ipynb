    "<div align=\"justify\">Here you will be able to analyse data taken by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The aim of this study is for you to be able to search for differences in the behaviour of matter and [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter). This project will enable you to carry out your own data analysis at a level similar to that of CERN research. This project does not require a detailed knowledge of particle physics. It is most suitable for people with a scientific and mathematical background equivalent to that required for applying for university entrance in a science, technology engineering or mathematics discipline. Some previous familiarity with computer programming would also be advantageous. Additional theoretical information or programming knowledge you might need is provided as the project progresses.</div>\n",

    "Before you start, you might find it helpful to find out more about matter antimatter asymmetries, what we hope to learn by studying them, and how we can detect them with experiments such as the LHCb experiment at CERN.\n",

    " - What is the [particle physics focus](Background-Information-Notebooks/ProjectIntro.ipynb) of this experiment? and what will I study in this project?\n",
    " - How does the LHCb [detector](Background-Information-Notebooks/DetectorSoftwareDataSample.ipynb) record the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have tried the analysis please provide feedback to help us improve this project using [this brief survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dEh4A4agmk5zpmR0zrhF79k-lJKV4vX1ETIGJjDscnc/viewform?c=0&w=1).\n",

We have measured the momentum of the kaon candidates in the detector, and have just plotted one of the components of the momentum of the kaon, and the magnitude of the momentum. The invariant mass of the kaon is well known and you can look this up. We wish to determine the energy of the kaons.    \n",

    "**B Meson Energy** - From energy conservation, the energy of the B meson will be the sum of the energies of the three kaons: $E_B=E_{K1}+E_{K2}+E_{K3}$, where $E_B$ is the energy of the B meson, $E_{K1}, E_{K2}, E_{K3}$ are the energies of each of the kaons. \n",
    "\n",
    "**B meson momentum** - From momentum conservation, the X component of the momentum of the B meson will be the sum of the X momentum components of the three Kaons : $px_B=px_{K1}+px_{K2}+px_{K3}$, where $px$ is the X direction component of the momentum of the B meson, $px_{K1},px_{K2},px_{K3}$ are the X direction components of the momenta of the three kaons. You can then do the same with the Y and Z components. Having obtained the X,Y, and z components of the B momentum you can find the magnitude of the momentum of the B meson.\n",
    "\n",
    "** B meson invariant mass*** - Rearrange the equation $E^2=p^2+m^2$ to find $m^2$. Using the values of the magnitude of the momentum of the B meson and the B meson Energy, find the mass of the B meson.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Histogram plotting** - Take care that the range of your mass plot is set suitably that you can see the mass peak. Once you have found the peak you can set the range appropriately. You do not have to start your graph at a mass of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Units** - The data you are provided has energies in 'MeV' (10<sup>6</sup> electron volts). The mass of the B meson is often quoted in 'GeV/c<sup>2</sup>' (10<sup>9</sup> electron volts)."

Dalitz plots can be used to identify these resonances which are visible as bands on the Dalitz plot.\n",

    "### Systematic Uncertainties\n",
    "In this analysis you considered the statistical uncertainty on the result. This occurs as a result of having only a limited number of events. In addition there are [systematic uncertainties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error#Systematic_versus_random_error), these arise from biases in your measurement. Here we discuss three sources of these for this analysis.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Production asymmetry. The LHC is a proton-proton collider and hence the initial state of the collision is not matter antimatter symmetric. Consequently B<sup>+</sup> and B<sup>-</sup> mesons may not be produced at exactly the same rates. This small production asymmetry it is estimated could be approximately 1%. It can also be measured from the data, as discussed in the LHCb paper.</li>\n",
    "<li> Detection asymmetry. The LHCb detector could be more efficient for detecting either the B<sup>+</sup> or the B<sup>-</sup> final states. This is because the positive and negative kaons will be bent by the magnet indifferent directions in the detector. If the efficiency of the detector is higher in one region than another this will lead to higher efficiencies for K<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>-</sup> and hence for B<sup>+</sup> or B<sup>-</sup>. For this reason the magnetic field of the LHCb detector is regularly reversed. You used data in this analysis in which the magnetic field was both up and down and hence the effect will (partially) cancel. By comparing results for the two magnet polarities separately you can check the size of this effect. When loading the data above both polarities were combined, you can instead load them independently to measure the difference between the two datasets.</li>\n",
    "<li> Analysis technique. The analysis technique you have used may bias the result. A major simplification we made in the analysis above was to neglect 'background' events. We imposed a selection to select a sample of predominantly signal events but have not accounted for the effect of the residual background events.</li>\n",

    "### Using mass sidebands\n",
    "\n",
    "One source of 'background' events arises from random combinations of tracks in events that happen to fake the 'signal' characteristics. These events will not peak in the mass distribution at the mass of the B meson but rtaher will have a smoothly varying distribution. Looking at the number and distribution of of events away from the mass peak can allow you to estimate the number of background events under the mass peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitting distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level of sophistication in the analysis requires fitting the distributions of events that are observed in the B mass distribution in order to estimate the yield of signal events and background events. You can see how this is done in the LHCb paper on the analysis. Fitting can be performed using the [CERN root framework](https://root.cern.ch/)."

    "<li>B<sup>+</sup> → K<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>K<sup>−</sup> (and anti-particle equivalent). This is the analysis you have performed here. It has the lowest background of the four channels and hence the approximation we made of neglecting the background events will give the least bias to this channel.</li>\n",
    "<li>B<sup>+</sup> → &pi;<sup>+</sup>&pi;<sup>+</sup>&pi;<sup>−</sup> (and anti-particle equivalent). In this analysis the final state is three charged pions. The level of background events compared to the signal is significantly higher as pions are the most commonly produced particle at the LHC. Hence, a method of estimating the background level should be added to complete this analysis.</li>\n",
    "<li>B<sup>+</sup> → K<sup>+</sup>&pi;<sup>+</sup>&pi;<sup>−</sup> (and anti-particle equivalent). In this analysis the final state is a mixture of one kaon and two pions. This means that the analysis needs to determine in each event which track is the best candidate kaon and apply selection cuts appropriately to select out the events.</li>\n",
